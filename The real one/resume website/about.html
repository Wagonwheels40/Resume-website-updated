    <section id="welcome-section" class="welcome-section">
        <p class="about">I have previously worked in several different industries.
        My most recent role has been at ‘Statewide Independent Wholesalers’ in Tasmania, which
        is a distribution warehouse where I worked for 2 years.  I have gone into more detail on the tab 'Work & Study timeline', but I thought I’d briefly talk about what led me to my interest in coding.</p>  
        
        <p class="about">I enjoyed working at Statewide Independent Wholesalers, but it was a very physically demanding job which I couldn't see myself doing on the long term.  It became clear to me that I had to look for something more rewarding, and this is when I decided to enrol for a Certificate III of IT at TAFE.  It was the first IT course I studied, but I quickly became invested to the programming cluster of the course.  I would spend hours a day working through the modules on ‘freecodecamp’ and ‘sololearn’ to improve my skills, and then I started working on projects I found on 'Github'.  Through this course, I learned how to make basic websites and learn the fundamentals of my first programming language, 'Python'.</p>  
            
        <p class="about">I then decided I wanted to pursue a career as a front-end software developer, as I enjoyed the design aspect of building websites through 'HTML' and 'CSS'.  I also have a goal of creating apps for Android, which is why I've been self studying 'Javascript' and 'C#' as well.  I have made a 'Github' for all of my projects I've been working on and I plan to expand this page as I learn more everyday.  I have been learning coding for approximately 6 months now, and I’m still as eager to working on small projects and coding as I was when I first started my IT course.</p>

        <p class="about">The 'Coding Work' tab will give you an indication of my current proficiency.  I hope to be given an opportunity to showcase my skills and help out in a team environment.</p>
