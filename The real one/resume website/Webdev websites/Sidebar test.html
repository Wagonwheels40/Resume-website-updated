          This website is dedicated to the pursuit of learning history.  History is often taught in a
          dry and boring way.  This website aims to teach history through narrative and tests.  I hope
          this project will inspire people to dig deeper into some of the topics
          which are presented.

        For years, Germany was made up of various states which were independent from one another.  
        However, in 1867, Bismarck decided to unify some of the northern states in Germany under 
        the power of Prussia.  Subsequently, in 1870-1871, Prussia defeated the French in the 
        Franco-Prussian war.  This defeat marked the foundation of the German Empire, but it also 
        marked a shift in power.  Paris was no longer the focal point in Europe, and now Berlin 
        became the most powerful state.

        The Austrian Hapsburgs formed a dual monarchy with Hungary in what is often referred to 
        as the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  This was an allegiance which was created by the emperor 
        and king of Hungary, Franz Joseph.

        <p class="first-paragraph">On May 1882, the triple alliance between Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy was formed in secret.
           One of the key reasons for this was that The condition made was that if Italy were to be invaded 
           by France without provocation, Germany and Austria would have to come to its aid.  Likewise, if Germany
           were to be attacked by France they would defend Germany.  If Austria-Hungary and Russia came into 
           conflict, Italy would remain neutral.

          Otto Von Bismarck was the chancellor of Prussia, as well as the first chancellor ever in Germany.  
          He was known for his military accomplishments, and stirn rule.  He unified 39 individual states into

          Kaiser Wilhelm was the King of Prussia.  He was often characterized by his birth defect, in which his 
          left arm was paralysed.  He was very self-conscious about his arm, and is known to have been very stirn, 
          temperamental and ruthless.  He was often perceived as a threat by others because of this.  
        </p>

        <p>Franz Joseph was the emperor of Austria and king of Hungary.  He formed the dual alliance between 
          Austria and Hungary, thereby forming Austria-Hungary.  He rose to power in 1849, and although his 
          public image was not tarnished by all and was often noted for his public ceremonies, he was still 
          responsible for ethinc division and anger.  He is most prominently known for annexing Bosnia-Herzegovina 
          in 1908, causing tension amongst the Serbian population in Austria-Hungary.
